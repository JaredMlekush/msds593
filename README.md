**TARDINESS.** Please be on time for class and do not pop in and out of zoom as it can be distracting.

**ACADEMIC HONESTY.** You must abide by the copyright laws of the United States and academic honesty policies of USF. You may not copy code from other current or previous students. All suspicious activity will be investigated and, if warranted, passed to the Dean of Sciences for action.  Copying answers or code from other students or sources during a quiz, exam, or for a project is a violation of the university’s honor code and will be treated as such. Plagiarism consists of copying material from any source and passing off that material as your own original work. Plagiarism is plagiarism: it does not matter if the source being copied is on the Internet, from a book or textbook, or from quizzes or problem sets written up by other students. Giving code or showing code to another student is also considered a violation.

The golden rule: **You must never represent another person’s work as your own.**

If you ever have questions about what constitutes plagiarism, cheating, or academic dishonesty in my course, please feel free to ask me.

*All persons with common code are likely to be considered at fault.*

**USF policies and legal declarations**

All students are expected to behave in accordance with the [Student Conduct Code](https://myusf.usfca.edu/fogcutter/student-conduct) and other University policies.

USF upholds the standards of honesty and integrity from all members of the academic community. All students are expected to know and adhere to the University's [Honor Code](https://myusf.usfca.edu/academic-integrity/honor-code)

## Student evaluation

| Artifact | Grade Weight | Due date |
|--------|--------|--------|
|[foo](bar)| 10%| ? |
|Quiz 1| 10%| when? |
|Quiz 2| 10%|  |
|Quiz 3| 10%| |
|Quiz 4| 10%| |
|Quiz 5| 10%| |

Each project has a hard deadline and only those projects working correctly before the deadline get credit.

*I reserve the right to change projects until the day they are assigned.*

**Grading standards**. I consider an **A** grade to be above and beyond what most students have achieved. A **B** grade is an average grade for a student or what you could call "competence" in a business setting. A **C** grade means that you either did not or could not put forth the effort to achieve competence. Below **C** implies you did very little work or had great difficulty with the class compared to other students.
